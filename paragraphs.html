        Bordered by the Drava and the Danube rivers and divided by Croatian-Hungarian state border, in the east charmed
        by a swamp, in the south and southeast sheltered by mouths of the river and in the north and northeast open for
        connection via wine roads and paths – Baranja is even today quite closed, almost secluded, more mystical than
        ever before. Despite old bridges having been renovated and new ones being built, regardless of the fact that it
        is dappled with several international road routes and that it is becoming an ever more interesting tourist
        destination – at this day Baranja manages to preserve a unique note since its people jealously keep their
        existential secrets. They strongly and clearly remember the tales older than their own families, secrets of life
        and survival, of love and dying, wines, hot peppers, special kind of fishing, weddings, buše (traditional masks
        from Baranja), pudarine (guarding ripening grapes), paunići (embroidered motifs of small peacocks on traditional
        folk costumes), slamnjače (straw beds) and i kandile (hanging candles). Owing to this still existent
        ethnographic magic which can be read from the faces of people living outside main roads, Baranja is capable of
        attracting, yet never revealing itself to the fullest.
