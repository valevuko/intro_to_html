        Story of the Park
    </h3>
    <p>
        Kopacki rit – a wetland home to thousands of species. A paradise for birds, and shelter to hundreds of bird
        species. A natural triangle between the rivers Danube and Drava, and the largest internal delta of the Danube.
        This area is one of the largest European wetlands, and it never looks the same, with every new visit bringing a
        new insight into nature. Kopački rit is a mystical place where one returns to the unhindered fullness of life.

        The boat waiting at the Veliki Sakadaš pier takes visitors into the adventure of exploring the floodplains of
        the Danube. Starting from the lake of Sakadaš, the boat passes through the Čonakut channel to Hordovanj. Kopačko
        jezero is the largest lake, with large colonies of various bird species such as wild geese, ducks, cormorants,
        herons and egrets, terns, gulls, and the rulers of Kopački rit forests – white-tailed eagles
