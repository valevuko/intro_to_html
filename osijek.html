        <b>Osijek is the fourth-largest city in Croatia.</b>
        <br>
        It is the largest city and the economic and cultural centre of the eastern Croatian 
        region of Slavonia, as well as the administrative centre of Osijek-Baranja County. 
        Osijek is located on the right bank of the Drava River.
        
        The name was given to the city due to its position on elevated ground, which prevented 
        the city being flooded by the local swamp waters. Its name "Osijek" derives from the Croatian 
        word oseka, which means "ebb tide". Due to its history within the Habsburg monarchy and briefly 
        in the Ottoman Empire, as well as the presence of German, Hungarian, and Serbian minorities 
        throughout its history, Osijek has (or had) its names in other languages, Осек/Osek or Осијек/Osijek 
        in Serbian, Hungarian: Eszék, German: Esseg or Essegg, Turkish: Ösek, Latin: Essek.
        It is also spelled Esgek.

        Its ancient name was Mursa and is supposed to come from the Proto-Indo-European word *móri 
        (sea, marshland). The same root is perhaps seen in the toponyms "Marsonia" and "Mariniana".
